* Feed the MindSphere with information processed from image, video and voice recorded from the devices.
> `Dave` could take a snap from his cell phone and generate an event in MindSphere.
> `Dave` don't have to touch the device to get read its status.

* What is `IoT`?
    * IoT is the network of physical electronic devices, which enables to connect and exchange data without or with less interaction of human.
    * They try to creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and reduced human exertions.
    * The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, collecting and sharing data.
    * IoT, refers to the connection of devices (other than typical fare such as computers and smartphones) to the Internet. Cars, kitchen appliances, and even heart monitors can all be connected through the IoT. 

* But IOT is not limitted to boaring textual data only, it could be visual data!

* `MindSphere`
    * MindSphere is the cloud-based, open IoT operating system from Siemens.
    * MindSphere stores operational data and makes it accessible through digital applications (“MindApps”)
    * It connects your products, plants, systems, and machines of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) with advanced analytics.
    * It to allow industrial customers to make decisions based on valuable factual information.
    *  MindSphere help the customers to create their own software applications and services, MindSphere is equipped with open application programming interfaces (APIs) and development tools.
    * The system is used in applications such as automated production and vehicle fleet management.
    * E.g. `MindConnect Nano`
